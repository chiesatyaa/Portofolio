# Portofolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a Data Scientist focused on applying data analysis techniques to solve real-world problems and support data-driven decision making. Here, I share the projects I work on, which cover a wide range of topics from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to building predictive models using advanced machine learning algorithms.

About me: I have a strong background in statistics, machine learning, and programming, with experience working on a variety of data types (including numerical, text, and time series data). I am familiar with using tools and programming languages such as Python, R, SQL, and TensorFlow to design solutions that can solve business and technical challenges.

In addition, I have experience with various frameworks and libraries for data analysis and modeling, including:

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization. Scikit-learn and XGBoost for machine learning modeling. TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning and neural networks.
